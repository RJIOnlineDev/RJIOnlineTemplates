            <h2>What are you doing now in your newsroom or ad agency that you weren’t doing a year ago?</h2>

            <p>The Reynolds Journalism Institute at the Missouri School of Journalism has launched a Q&amp;A series featuring innovation and experimentation taking place in newsrooms and ad agencies. We’re looking for folks who would be willing to be interviewed for the series and share what they’re learning with others.</p>

            <p><strong>What kinds of projects are we looking for?</strong> The sky is the limit. Are you using a new technology like AR/VR, Periscope or drones? Maybe you’ve found a new way of interacting or engaging with your audience &mdash; online or in person. If it’s new, different and worth sharing, we’d like to hear about it.</p>

            <p><a href="/stories/series/whats-new-qa">Check out the series here.</a> If we’ve already written about the technology you’re using, feel free to submit your project anyway. Not all learning experiences are the same and not everyone is using the technologies for the same purpose or the same kinds of projects. Newsrooms/ad agencies come in all sizes. Projects come in all sizes, too, so don’t worry about yours being too big or too small. If you know of someone who has a project that would be a good fit for this series, feel free to forward this form to them.</p>
